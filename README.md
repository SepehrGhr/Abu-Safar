## üöÄ Getting Started with Docker

This project is fully containerized. Follow these steps to get the entire stack‚Äîapplication, database, and cache‚Äîrunning with a single command.

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Docker**
* **Docker Compose**

Ensure both are installed and running on your system.

### 2. Environment Configuration

The application stack is configured using an `.env` file in the project root.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Copy the following content into the file and replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration.

```dotenv
# PostgreSQL Database Settings
# These are used by docker-compose to initialize the database
DB_NAME=abusafar_db
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password

# JWT Secret (must be a long, secure, random string)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-that-is-long-enough

# Email (for OTP and Notifications, e.g., using a Gmail App Password)
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password

# SMS Service (Optional, for OTP via SMS)
SMS_URL=your_sms_provider_url
SMS_API_KEY=your_sms_provider_api_key
SMS_TEMPLATE=your_sms_provider_template_id
```

**Note**: The Spring Boot application inside the Docker container is automatically configured to connect to the database and Redis services via the Docker network.

### 3. Running the Application

With Docker running and the `.env` file configured, start the entire application stack:

```bash
# Build the images and start the containers in detached mode
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The services will be launched:
* **AbuSafar Application**: Available at `http://localhost:8080`
* **PostgreSQL Database**: Accessible on host port `5432`
* **Redis**: Accessible on host port `6379`

The database schema (`db/AbuSafar.sql`) is automatically initialized the first time the database container starts.

### 4. (Optional) Populating with Test Data

If you want to populate the database with sample data, run the following command after the containers are up and running:

```bash
# Execute the TestData.sql script inside the running postgres container
docker-compose exec -T abusafar-db psql -U ${DB_USER} -d ${DB_NAME} < db/TestData.sql
```

*Note: This command may require the `DB_USER` and `DB_NAME` environment variables to be present in your shell, or you can replace them with the literal values from your `.env` file.*

Alternatively, you can configure and run the Go data seeder located in `seed_data/`.

### 5. Stopping the Application

To stop all the running containers, use:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
To stop the containers and remove the persistent database volume, add the `-v` flag:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

## üìÑ API Documentation

This project's API is fully documented using the OpenAPI 3.0 standard. You can explore and interact with all the endpoints in two ways:

### 1. Live Interactive Documentation (Recommended)

A standalone, interactive documentation page is generated from our `openapi.yml` and is hosted on GitHub Pages. This is the easiest way for anyone to view the API, with no local setup required.

> [**View Live API Documentation**](https://SepehrGhr.github.io/Abu-Safar/api-doc.html)

### 2. Local Swagger UI

Once the application is running on your local machine, you can access the built-in Swagger UI to test the endpoints directly:

> [**http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html**](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

---

## üî¨ Testing the API

You can test the API using two primary methods:

### 1. Swagger UI (Recommended)

The easiest way to explore and test the API is via the integrated Swagger UI. Once the application is running, navigate to:

> [**http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html**](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

The UI provides a full list of endpoints, their required parameters, and allows you to execute requests directly from your browser.

### 2. API Client (Postman / Insomnia)

You can also use an API client like Postman. Here is a typical workflow:

1.  **Register a User**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/signup`.
2.  **Request OTP**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login/otp/request` with the user's email or phone.
3.  **Login with OTP**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/login/otp/verify`. The response will contain an `accessToken`.
4.  **Access Protected Endpoints**: For any protected endpoint, add an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer <your_accessToken>`.

#### Example: Get Booking History with `curl`

```bash
# First, log in to get a token (replace with your actual login flow)
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login/otp/verify \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"contactInfo": "user@example.com", "otp": "123456"}' | jq -r '.data.accessToken')

# Then, use the token to access a protected route
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/bookings/history \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
