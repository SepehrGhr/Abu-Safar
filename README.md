 ## üöÄ Getting Started with Docker

 This project is fully containerized. Follow these steps to get the entire stack‚Äîapplication, database, cache, and search engine‚Äîrunning with a single command.

 ### 1. Prerequisites

 * Docker
 * Docker Compose

 Ensure both are installed and running on your system.

 ### 2. Environment Configuration

 The application stack is configured using an .env file in the project root. Create this file and populate it with your configuration values.

 ### 3. Running the Application

 With Docker running and the .env file configured, start the entire application stack:

 bash  # Build the images and start all containers in detached mode  docker-compose up --build -d  

 After a few moments, the full ecosystem will be running. The services are available at the following locations:

 | Service                   | URL                       | Description                                  |
 | :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
 | AbuSafar Backend | http://localhost:8888   | The main application API.                    |
 | Kibana (Elasticsearch) | http://localhost:5601   | Visualize, explore, and manage search data.  |
 | AKHQ (Kafka) | http://localhost:8081   | Monitor Kafka topics and Debezium connectors.|
 | PostgreSQL Database | localhost:5432          | Primary transactional database.              |
 | Redis | localhost:6379          | Cache and session store.                     |

 ### 4. Stopping the Application

 To stop all the running containers, use:
 bash  docker-compose down  
 To stop the containers and remove all persistent data volumes, add the -v flag:
 bash  docker-compose down -v
